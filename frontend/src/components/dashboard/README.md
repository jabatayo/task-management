# Dashboard Components

This directory contains the refactored dashboard components, organized for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Component Structure

### Main Components

- **`Dashboard.tsx`** - Main dashboard component that orchestrates all sub-components
- **`DashboardHeader.tsx`** - Header section with title and "New Task" button
- **`MetricsCards.tsx`** - Grid of metric cards (Total, Completed, Pending, Overdue)
- **`CompletionRate.tsx`** - Progress bar showing task completion rate
- **`RecentActivity.tsx`** - List of recent task activities
- **`UpcomingDeadlines.tsx`** - List of upcoming task deadlines
- **`ErrorMessage.tsx`** - Reusable error message component

### Utilities

- **`utils.ts`** - Shared utility functions:
  - `getPriorityColor()` - Returns CSS classes for priority badges
  - `formatDate()` - Formats date strings for display

### Custom Hook

- **`useDashboard.ts`** - Custom hook for dashboard data fetching and state management

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual components without affecting others
4. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
5. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support with proper interfaces
6. **Custom Hook**: Data fetching logic is separated from UI components

## Usage

```tsx
import { Dashboard } from '../components/dashboard';

// The main Dashboard component handles all the complexity internally
<Dashboard />
```

## Data Flow

1. `useDashboard` hook fetches data from the API
2. Main `Dashboard` component receives data and passes it to sub-components
3. Each sub-component receives only the data it needs
4. Utility functions handle common operations like date formatting and priority styling

## Future Improvements

- Add loading states for individual components
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling
- Add refresh functionality for real-time updates
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large lists
